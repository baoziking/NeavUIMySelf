Lost Control v3.12

This is my first addon that I've written, just because I couldn't find one that suited my needs.

As a healer I was having issues wherein party members were unaware of me being stunned/silenced or otherwise incapacitated and unable to heal.

This addon will check your debuffs periodically and use name & description checking to determine the type and length of the debuff, notifying the appropriate channel where necessary.

It started off just being under development for me and people I know, but others are starting to find use for it.

As a small personal project, please be aware that there may be small bugs, in which case do let me know and I'll see what I can do, as I may not see them myself when playing.
